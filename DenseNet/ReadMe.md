This is the implementation of the paper titled "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks" [1] using Keras. It then uses the CIFAR-10 dataset to train the model.
This code was originally developed here: https://github.com/titu1994/DenseNet/blob/master/densenet.py.
However there was some minor errors which I corrected. I also cut the corners and tried to make the code as neata and simple as possible.
