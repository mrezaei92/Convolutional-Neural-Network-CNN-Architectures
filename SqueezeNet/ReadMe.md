This is the Keras implementation of the CNN arcitecture named "SqueezeNet". SqueezeNet is a CNN arcitecture that tries to gain a high accuracy while being memory efficient.
The paper can be found here:

I have tried to make the code as simple as possible.
It comes in two versions:

1- Vanilla SqueezeNet (simple_model.py)

2- SqueezeNet with simple bypass connections (bypass_model.py)

For more information, please refer to the original paper.
